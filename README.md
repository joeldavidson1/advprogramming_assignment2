# Advanced Programming Assignment 2 - Shapes

This program creates, deletes and updates shapes based on their co-ordinates. I have utilised all 4 main Object Oriented Programming principles: abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance

For the brief we had to follow certain rules and guidelines in order for the program to run through automatic tests to be graded, and as such Driver.cpp was given to us as a template. We was not allowed to change certain parts due to this.
